A final class project by Marvin Yan and Juan Leon.

This app allows you to interface with a DSC alarm panel from an Android device. 

On first use, tap the cogwheel in the upper right corner and input the IP address and password.

- The button in the center will swap between the keypad and the arm/emergency buttons.
- The button in the upper left corner will swap between the zone list and the activity log.
